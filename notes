5. Make it so users are redirected to login page or error page if they use a broken link
6. Why did adding 'required' fix my css problem? 
8. Make note text area expand as you type more
9. Get clicking outside of note form to also submit
11. Make it so editing title on show page does not expand create note form
13. Make it so when the page size changes the top of the create note form stays the same distance from the header
14. Make it so note size doesnt change when trashcan appears
15. Make it so the word email does not turn red when it errors and there is no input in the box
16. Make it so modal does not open when I click delete note on index (Right now I close it right after)

Idea: Track note position in db
Possibly use debounce so update after dragging is done
Or maybe use an unmount
On mouse release changes position?
