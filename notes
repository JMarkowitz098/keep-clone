5. Make it so users are redirected to login page or error page if they use a broken link
6. Why did adding 'required' fix my css problem? 
7. Center "Use Guest account" on login page
8. Make note text area expand as you type more
10. Make note you create first note
    -can't get old notes to update position


Idea: Track note position in db
Possibly use debounce so update after dragging is done
Or maybe use an unmount
On mouse release changes position?
